                <img src="./assets/images/IMG_3097.jpg" alt="Paris Pahlevan" height="300" width="300">
                <p>I first started my undergraduate
                    coursework at Hunter College as
                    Psychology and biological sciences
                    majors. I had immigrated to the
                    United States the year before to
                    pursue higher education and work
                    opportunities that were not
                    available to women in Iran.
                    In my third year as a student there,
                    I enrolled in a computer science class
                    to satisfy my general education
                    requirements and quickly became
                    fascinated with the subject.
                    I was drawn to how much I could
                    relate my observations about the
                    world around me with the concepts
                    I studied in my textbooks.
                    In that first class, I met the
                    man who later became my husband.
                    He is a very successful Software
                    Engineer and works for a startup
                    company. His special passion
                    for Computer coding and
                    computer science class excited
                    and motivated me in both an
                    intellectual and deeply
                    personal way.</p>
                <p>Coding gives me the power of creating
                    solutions to problems and putting my
                    creative ideas into action. It is
                    amazing to see that the code you write,
                    will develop in the live system and
                    actual people will use it.</p>
                <p>As someone who went through two major
                    moves, first from Iran to Germany and
                    then Germany to the United States,
                    I believe that my experience also
                    gives me greater insight and
                    understanding into how the evolution
                    of technology moves at rapid pace and
                    how coding is impacting the future of
                    technology and the future of our lives
                    in ways weâ€™re only beginning to
                    understand.</p>
